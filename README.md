Assumptions: It is assumed that all service providers remain up and running, such as google drive, github and Unity 5 as an engine. 

Risks: Risks could include a project member dropping out of the course. This could be planned for by distributing assignments so there is always a backup-member for a certain assignment who has the same capabilities to do the task. Another way could be not engaging in tasks that include technologies no other members are aware of utilizing. 
Another risk could be the skills of a group, and how to pick it up for new members. What will happen if a task requires a certain programming language or so?
Constraint: Resource constraints are present in terms of having 4 group members who also have other courses are the university. Therefore, time must be must be divided up to match the expected workload for the course, which is 10 weeks of studying. Also there is no budget. 

Client-interaction: The client is Dr. Roberto, professor in games design. Therefore, the project does not exactly match the desired scenario of having a specific customer. However, Dr. Roberto will evaluate iterations, guide and provide feedback, and give constructive criticism to the project, defining tasks which a client would through the development iterations.
